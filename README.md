## Traits of birds involved in biological invasions

Scripts and data for  reproducing the results obtained by Marino & Bellard (2022) in the paper "When origin, reproduction ability, and diet define the role of birds in invasions"

The first script computes the axes of the multidimensionnal functional space based on the traits of both alien and IAS-threatened birds. The second script performs the statistical analyses based on the functional space and creates the figures 1 and 4. The third script performs the trait-by-trait analysis and creates the figured 2 and 3. The last script describes the steps implemented for evaluating the prediction of impact type based on the position of birds in the functional space.
